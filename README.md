## About The Project

1) Implementation of Deep Convolutonal GAN (DCGAN) architecture from `UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS` paper:

        https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf
        
2) Implementation of Loss Function, gradient penalty as it was proposed in `Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs` paper:

        https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf

3) Training pipeline for MNIST and LSUN datasets.
